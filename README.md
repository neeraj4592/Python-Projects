# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

### tweetering.py runs a Python script to fetch most recent tweets based on the word given in the parameter.
I have added two text files - clinton.txt and trump.txt and analysed them to find the total score of the sentiments before the presidential elections in 2016. 

### 'Sentiment Analysis.ipynb' shows the data cleaning, data preparation and the analysis.
